# DNA sequencing reads processing workflows

This repository keeps a collect of workflows for ARGO variant calling. All workflows use tools defined and released in multiple repositories: https://github.com/icgc-argo/dna-seq-processing-tools, https://github.com/icgc-argo/data-processing-utility-tools and https://github.com/icgc-argo/gatk-tools. Every tool (including associated container image registered in Quay.io) is strictly version controlled to ensure reproducibility of the tools themselves and workflows composed from them.
